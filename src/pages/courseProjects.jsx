								Back in 2022, I completed the Software
								Engineering Immersive at General Assembly â€” a
								fast-paced, part-time course that gave me a
								solid foundation in web development. It covered
								everything from front-end fundamentals to
								full-stack app development using JavaScript,
								React, Node.js, and more. It was an intense five
								months of building projects, collaborating with
								other learners, and getting hands-on experience
								with real-world tools and workflows. The
								projects below came out of that course and
								marked the beginning of my formal training in
								web development.The course was split into four
								terms, each with a project outcome:
								<ul>
									<li>
										Term 1: Frontend with HTML, CSS &
										Javascript
									</li>
									<li>Term 2: Backend with Python</li>
									<li>Term 3: Fullstack using Node.js</li>
									<li>Term 4: Modern webapps with React</li>
								</ul>
								<a href="#top">
									Top{" "}
									<FontAwesomeIcon

								<br />
								It's been a couple of years since I completed
								the GA Software Engineering Immersive, so I
								wanted a structured way to refresh my frontend
								skills and make sure I was up to date with the
								latest practices. That's what led me to the
								Frontend Developer Career Path at Scrimba. It's
								a super practical, project-based course that's
								been great for reinforcing my knowledge of HTML,
								CSS, JavaScript, and React. The projects below
								were built as part of the course, and it's been
								a really useful way to rebuild muscle memory and
								sharpen my skills while balancing a full-time
								job.<br />
