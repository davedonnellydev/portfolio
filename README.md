This is the source code for my portfolio website, [davedonnelly.dev](https://davedonnelly.dev), built to showcase my frontend development work and document my career shift into tech. It's powered by **React**, styled with **CSS Modules**, and dynamically displays selected GitHub projects using the GitHub API. The site is based on the [Reactfolio](https://github.com/truethari/reactfolio) template, with custom enhancements to reflect my style and way of working.
