# Portfolio website
I've built my portfolio website based on the template built by @truethari found here: https://github.com/truethari/reactfolio. 

I've updated some of the styling and also used the GitHub API to call all my repos containing specific topics to appear on specific pages, allowing me to add projects to my portfolio with the addition of a couple of simple topics.
